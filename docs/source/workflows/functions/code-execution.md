# Code Execution

NeMo Agent toolkit supports python code execution in a remote sandbox environment through use of the `code_execution` function. This function sends a string of python code to a remote code execution server where code is executed, and the result, status, and any errors are returned

## Usage
Currently NeMo Agent toolkit supports code execution through the included `local_sandbox` (a locally run code execution docker container) and via a remote [Piston Server](https://github.com/engineer-man/piston). In order to utilize `code_execution` as part of your workflow this server must be running and accepting requests.

To start the `local_sandbox`you must have docker installed. If docker is not installed on your machine, follow the appropriate instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) to install docker on your machine. Once docker is installed and running, navigate to the `local_sandbox` directory and run the `start_local_sandbox.sh` script.

```bash
# from the root of the repository
$ cd src/nat/tool/code_execution/local_sandbox
$ source start_local_sandbox.sh
```
It will take a bit of time for the container to build and initialize, but once you see the following, the server is ready:
```bash
*** uWSGI is running in multiple interpreter mode ***
spawned uWSGI master process (pid: 9)
spawned uWSGI worker 1 (pid: 11, cores: 1)
spawned uWSGI worker 2 (pid: 12, cores: 1)

spawned uWSGI worker 9 (pid: 19, cores: 1)
spawned uWSGI worker 10 (pid: 20, cores: 1)

2025-03-14 02:02:11,060 INFO success: quit_on_failure entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for > than 1 seconds (startsecs)
```

For Piston servers, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/engineer-man/piston) to set up a Piston server, or connect to an existing Piston server if you have access to one. Once the server is running you can run your workflow.

The config object for the `code_execution` function is shown below:
```python
class CodeExecutionToolConfig(FunctionBaseConfig, name="code_execution"):
    """
    Tool for executing python code in a remotely hosted sandbox environment.
    """
    uri: HttpUrl = Field(default="http://127.0.0.1:6000", description="URI for the code execution sandbox server")
    sandbox_type: str = Field(default="local", description="The type of code execution sandbox")
    timeout: float = Field(default=10.0, description="Number of seconds to wait for a code execution request")
    max_output_characters: int = Field(default=1000, description="Maximum number of characters that can be returned")
```
The defaults for this config are set use the `local_sandbox`server with a default timeout of 10s and a maximum output of 1000 characters. Below is an example of how this would look in the config file:
```yaml
functions:
    code_execution_tool:
      _type: code_execution
```

Below is an example config that connects to a Piston server with a timeout of 30s and a maximum of 3000 characters returned:
```yaml
functions:
    code_execution_tool:
      _type: code_execution
      uri: "http://my-piston-server"
      timeout: 30
      max_output_characters: 3000
```

This remote code execution servers return JSON object containing the execution status, `stdout`, and `stderr`. For example:

```json
{
    "process_status": "completed",
    "stdout": "Hello World\n\n",
    "stderr": ""
}
```
If code execution results in an error, this will show up in `stderr`:
```json
{
    "process_status": "error",
    "stdout": "",
    "stderr": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 19, in <module>\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n\n"
}
```
Lastly, it is worth noting that the only thing returned to the function calling the `code_execution` function is (assuming no errors) whatever is printed out to `stdout`. No other artifacts, such as files or in memory objects, are returned from the sandbox, so it is important that the desired result of the code execution is printed out.

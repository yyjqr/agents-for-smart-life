# About NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Workflows

Workflows are the heart of the NeMo Agent toolkit because they define which agentic tools and models are used to perform a given task or series of tasks.

## Understanding the Workflow Configuration File

The workflow configuration file is a YAML file that specifies the tools and models to use in a workflow, along with general configuration settings. This section examines the configuration of the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow to show how they're organized.

`examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml`:
```yaml
functions:
  webpage_query:
    _type: webpage_query
    webpage_url: https://docs.smith.langchain.com
    description: "Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!"
    embedder_name: nv-embedqa-e5-v5
    chunk_size: 512
  current_datetime:
    _type: current_datetime

llms:
  nim_llm:
    _type: nim
    model_name: meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct
    temperature: 0.0

embedders:
  nv-embedqa-e5-v5:
    _type: nim
    model_name: nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5

workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  tool_names: [webpage_query, current_datetime]
  llm_name: nim_llm
  verbose: true
  parse_agent_response_max_retries: 3
```

This workflow configuration is divided into four sections: `functions`, `llms`, `embedders`, and `workflow`. The `functions` section contains the tools used in the workflow, while `llms` and `embedders` define the models used in the workflow, and lastly the `workflow` section ties the other sections together and defines the workflow itself.

In this workflow the `webpage_query` tool is used to query the LangSmith User Guide, and the `current_datetime` tool is used to get the current date and time. The `description` entry is what is used to instruct the LLM when and how to use the tool. In this case, the `description` is explicitly defined for the `webpage_query` tool.

The `webpage_query` tool makes use of the `nv-embedqa-e5-v5` embedder, which is defined in the `embedders` section.

For details on workflow configuration, including sections not utilized in the above example, refer to the [Workflow Configuration](../workflow-configuration.md) document.

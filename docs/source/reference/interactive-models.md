# Interactive Models Guide
NeMo Agent toolkit provides interactive prompt and response Pydantic data models as a way to validate, serialize, and document
data structures to support human input during the execution of an agent workflow.
**Note**: All human in the loop interaction data models are supported by the `nat serve` command, while the `nat run`
command **only** supports the {py:mod}`nat.data_models.interactive.HumanPromptText` data model. Ensure WebSocket mode
is enabled by toggling the setting in the top-right corner of the webpage for proper interaction when using this feature
with the front-end user interface.

## How to Use Interactive Prompt and Response Data Models
Start by acquiring an instance of the {class}`nat.builder.user_interaction_manager.UserInteractionManager` class
from the {class}`nat.builder.context.Context` instance.
```python
context = Context.get()
user_input_manager = context.user_interaction_manager
```

Once the {py:mod}`nat.builder.user_interaction_manager.UserInteractionManager` has been acquired, use the Interaction
Prompt data models located here: {py:mod}`nat.data_models.interactive` to create a user defined prompt of your choosing
i.e. {py:mod}`nat.data_models.interactive.HumanPromptText` to prompt user interaction during work flow execution.
```python
human_prompt_text = HumanPromptText(text="Hello, how are you today?", required=True, placeholder="default")
```

Pass the interaction prompt instance to the `prompt_user_input` method from the {py:mod}`nat.builder.user_interaction_manager.UserInteractionManager`  Once called the workflow will pause execution and wait for user input which can be handled
by processing the returned interaction response instance.
```python
response = await user_input_manager.prompt_user_input(human_prompt_text)
```

Finally, process the returned response from the user input.
**Note**: The response will be an instance of the corresponding data model that matches the type of user-defined interactive prompt.
```python
assert (isinstance(response.content, HumanResponseText))
return response.content.text
```

Complete example:
```python
async def _inner(prompt: str) -> str:
    try:
        context = Context.get()
        user_input_manager = context.user_interaction_manager

        human_prompt_text = HumanPromptText(text="Hello, how are you today?", required=True, placeholder="default")

        response = await user_input_manager.prompt_user_input(human_prompt_text)

        assert (isinstance(response.content, HumanResponseText))

        return response.content.text

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error("An error occurred when getting interaction content: %s", e)

        raise
```

# Semantic Kernel Example

A minimal example using Semantic Kernel showcasing a multi-agent travel planning system where an Itinerary Agent creates a travel schedule, a Budget Agent ensures cost compliance, and a Summarizer Agent formats the final itinerary. **Please note that we only support OpenAI models currently**.

- [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup)
  - [Install this Workflow](#install-this-workflow)
  - [Set Up API Keys](#set-up-api-keys)
- [Adding Long-Term Memory](#adding-long-term-memory)

## Key Features

- **Semantic Kernel Framework Integration:** Demonstrates NeMo Agent toolkit support for Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework alongside other frameworks like LangChain.
- **Multi-Agent Travel Planning:** Shows three specialized agents working together - an Itinerary Agent for schedule creation, a Budget Agent for cost management, and a Summarizer Agent for final formatting.
- **Cross-Agent Coordination:** Demonstrates how different agents can collaborate on a complex task, with each agent contributing its specialized capabilities to the overall workflow.
- **Long-Term Memory Integration:** Includes optional Mem0 platform integration for persistent memory, allowing agents to remember user preferences (like vegan dining or luxury hotel preferences) across sessions.
- **OpenAI Model Support:** Showcases NeMo Agent toolkit compatibility with OpenAI models through the Semantic Kernel framework integration.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit.

### Install this Workflow

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/frameworks/semantic_kernel_demo
```

### Set Up API Keys

You need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable to access OpenAI AI services:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Adding Long-Term Memory

 With NeMo Agent toolkit, adding Long Term Memory (LTM) is as simple as adding a new section in the configuration file.

Once you add the LTM configuration, export your Mem0 API key, which is a prerequisite for using the LTM service. To create an API key, refer to the instructions in the [Mem0 Platform Guide](https://docs.mem0.ai/platform/quickstart).

Once you have your API key, export it as follows:

```bash
export MEM0_API_KEY=<YOUR_MEM0_API_KEY>
```

Then, you can run the workflow with the LTM configuration as follows:

```bash
nat run --config_file examples/frameworks/semantic_kernel_demo/configs/config.yml --input "Create a 3-day travel itinerary for Tokyo in April, suggest hotels  within a USD 2000 budget. I like staying at expensive hotels and am vegan"
```

**Expected Workflow Output**
The workflow produces a large amount of output, the end of the output should contain something similar to the following:

```console

Please note that it is normal to see the LLM produce some errors on occasion as it handles complex structured tool calls. The workflow will automatically attempt to correct and retry the failed tool calls.

Assuming we've successfully added our preference for vegan restaurants in the last prompt to the agent, let us attempt to retrieve a more personalized itinerary with vegan dining options:

```bash
nat run --config_file examples/frameworks/semantic_kernel_demo/configs/config.yml --input "On a 1-day travel itinerary for Tokyo in April, suggest restaurants I would enjoy."
```

**Expected Workflow Output**

```

The above output demonstrates that the agent was able to draw from memory to provide vegan-friendly recommendations.

Note: The long-term memory feature relies on LLM-based tool invocation, which can occasionally be non-deterministic. If you notice that the memory functionality isn't working as expected (e.g., the agent doesn't remember your preferences), try these solutions:
* Re-run your first and second inputs to ensure proper tool invocation
* Fine-tune the `long_term_memory_instructions` section in `config.yml` to better guide the agent's memory usage

These steps will help ensure your preferences are correctly stored and retrieved by the agent.

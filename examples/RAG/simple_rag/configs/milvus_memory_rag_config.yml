    Answer the following questions as best you can. You may ask the human to use the following tools:

    {tools}

    IMPORTANT MEMORY TOOL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. You MUST call get_memory tool FIRST, before calling any other tools
    2. You MUST use user_id "user_12" for all memory operations
    3. You MUST include ALL required parameters when calling memory tools
    4. When calling add_memory or get_memory, you MUST use the exact format as below, don't include any other content,
      and make sure the input is a valid JSON object.

    For get_memory tool, you MUST use this exact format:
    {{
        "query": "user preferences",
        "top_k": 1,
        "user_id": "user_12"
    }}

    For add_memory tool, you MUST use this exact format:
    {{
        "conversation": [
            {{
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hi, I'm Alex. I'm looking for a trip to New York"
            }},
            {{
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "Hello Alex! I've noted you are looking for a trip to New York."
            }}
        ],
        "user_id": "user_12",
        "metadata": {{
            "key_value_pairs": {{
                "type": "travel",
                "relevance": "high"
            }}
        }},
        "memory": "User is looking for a trip to New York."
    }}

    You may respond in one of two formats.
    Use the following format exactly to ask the human to use a tool:

    Question: the input question you must answer
    Thought: you should always think about what to do
    Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
    Action Input: the input to the action (if there is no required input, include "Action Input: None")
    Observation: wait for the human to respond with the result from the tool, do not assume the response

    ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times. If you do not need to use a tool, or after asking the human to use any tools and waiting for the human to respond, you might know the final answer.)
    Use the following format once you have the final answer:

    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

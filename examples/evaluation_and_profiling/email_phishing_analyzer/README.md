## Key Features

- **Email Security Analysis:** Demonstrates an `email_phishing_analyzer` tool that examines email content for suspicious patterns, social engineering tactics, and phishing indicators using LLM-based analysis.
- **ReAct Agent Integration:** Uses a `react_agent` that can reason about email content and determine when to invoke the phishing analysis tool based on suspicious characteristics.
- **Phishing Detection Workflow:** Shows how to analyze emails for common phishing techniques including requests for sensitive information, urgency tactics, and suspicious sender patterns.
- **Security-Focused LLM Application:** Demonstrates how to apply AI reasoning to cybersecurity use cases with specialized prompting and analysis workflows.
- **Threat Assessment Pipeline:** Provides a foundation for building automated email security screening systems that can classify potential threats.


## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Example Usage

### Run the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
nat run --config_file examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/configs/config.yml --input "Dear [Customer], Thank you for your purchase on [Date]. We have processed a refund of $[Amount] to your account. Please provide your account and routing numbers so we can complete the transaction. Thank you, [Your Company]"
```

The configuration file specified above contains configurations for the NeMo Agent Toolkit `evaluation` and `profiler` capabilities. Additional documentation for evaluation configuration can be found in the [evaluation guide](../../../docs/source/workflows/evaluate.md). Furthermore, similar documentation for profiling configuration can be found in the [profiling guide](../../../docs/source/workflows/profiler.md).

Agent input: Dear [Customer], Thank you for your purchase on [Date]. We have processed a refund of 0 to your account. Please provide your account and routing numbers so we can complete the transaction. Thank you, [Your Company]
Agent's thoughts:
Thought: This email seems suspicious as it asks for sensitive information such as account and routing numbers. I should analyze it for signs of phishing.

Action: email_phishing_analyzer

Tool's input: {"text": "Dear [Customer], Thank you for your purchase on [Date]. We have processed a refund of 0 to your account. Please provide your account and routing numbers so we can complete the transaction. Thank you, [Your Company]"}
Tool's response:
{"is_likely_phishing": true, "explanation": "The email exhibits suspicious signals that may indicate phishing. Specifically, the email requests sensitive personal information (account and routing numbers) under the guise of completing a refund transaction. Legitimate companies typically do not request such information via email, as it is a security risk. Additionally, the refund amount of '0' is unusual and may be an attempt to create a sense of urgency or confusion. The tone of the email is also somewhat generic and lacks personalization, which is another common trait of phishing emails."}

Agent's thoughts:
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: This email is likely a phishing attempt, as it requests sensitive personal information and exhibits other suspicious signals.

## Deployment-Oriented Setup

For a production deployment, use Docker:

### Build the Docker Image

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the NeMo Agent toolkit virtual environment.

From the root directory of the Simple Calculator repository, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --build-arg NAT_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -t email_phishing_analyzer -f examples/evaluation_and_profiling/email_phishing_analyzer/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Docker Container
Deploy the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY email_phishing_analyzer
```

### Test the API
Use the following curl command to test the deployed API:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input_message": "Dear [Customer], Thank you for your purchase on [Date]. We have processed a refund of $[Amount] to your account. Please provide your account and routing numbers so we can complete the transaction. Thank you, [Your Company]"}'
```

### Expected API Output
The API response should look like this:

```json
{"value":"This email is likely a phishing attempt. It requests sensitive information, such as account and routing numbers, which is a common tactic used by scammers. The email also lacks specific details about the purchase, which is unusual for a refund notification. Additionally, the greeting is impersonal, which suggests a lack of personalization. It is recommended to be cautious when responding to such emails and to verify the authenticity of the email before providing any sensitive information."}
```

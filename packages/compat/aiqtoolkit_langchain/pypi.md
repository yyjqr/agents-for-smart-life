# Transitional Package for `nvidia-nat-langchain`
This is a transitional package for `nvidia-nat-langchain` to help ease the migration to `nvidia-nat-langchain`, and will be removed in a future release. It is recommended to use `nvidia-nat-langchain` directly for new projects.

For more information about the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit, please visit the [NeMo Agent toolkit package](https://pypi.org/project/nvidia-nat-langchain/).

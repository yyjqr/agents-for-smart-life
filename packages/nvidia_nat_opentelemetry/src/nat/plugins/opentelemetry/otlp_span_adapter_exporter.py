class OTLPSpanAdapterExporter(OTLPSpanExporterMixin, OtelSpanExporter):  # pylint: disable=R0901
    """An OpenTelemetry OTLP span exporter for sending traces to OTLP-compatible services.

    This class combines the OtelSpanExporter base functionality with OTLP-specific
    export capabilities to provide a complete solution for sending telemetry traces
    to any OTLP-compatible collector or service via HTTP.

    Key Features:
    - Complete span processing pipeline (IntermediateStep → Span → OtelSpan → Export)
    - Batching support for efficient transmission
    - OTLP HTTP protocol for maximum compatibility
    - Configurable authentication via headers
    - Resource attribute management
    - Error handling and retry logic

    This exporter is commonly used with services like:
    - OpenTelemetry Collector
    - Jaeger (OTLP endpoint)
    - Grafana Tempo
    - Custom OTLP-compatible backends

    Example:
        exporter = OTLPSpanAdapterExporter(
            endpoint="https://api.service.com/v1/traces",
            headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your-token"},
            batch_size=50,
            flush_interval=10.0
        )

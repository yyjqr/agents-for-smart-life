class IsolatedAttribute(Generic[IsolatedAttributeT]):
    """Descriptor for copy-on-write isolation.

    This descriptor uses Python's descriptor protocol to automatically manage
    attribute isolation during object copying. It enables efficient concurrent
    execution by sharing expensive resources while isolating mutable state.

    Performance Note: This pattern shares expensive resources (HTTP clients,
    auth headers) while isolating cheap mutable state (task sets, events).
    Tasks are tracked for monitoring but don't block shutdown - they complete
    asynchronously in the event loop. Critical for high-throughput concurrent execution.

    Implementation Note: Uses Python descriptor protocol (__get__, __set__, __set_name__)
    for automatic attribute isolation on object copying.

    Example:
        class MyExporter(BaseExporter):
            # Expensive HTTP client shared across instances
            _client = expensive_http_client

            # Cheap mutable state isolated per instance
            _tasks: IsolatedAttribute[set] = IsolatedAttribute(set)

        exporter1 = MyExporter(endpoint="https://api.service.com")

        # exporter2 shares _client but has isolated _tasks tracking

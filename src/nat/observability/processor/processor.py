    """Generic protocol for processors that can convert between types in export pipelines.

    Processors are the building blocks of processing pipelines in exporters. They can
    transform data from one type to another, enabling flexible data processing chains.

    The generic types work as follows:
    - InputT: The type of items that this processor accepts
    - OutputT: The type of items that this processor produces

    Key Features:
    - Type-safe transformations through generics
    - Type introspection capabilities via TypeIntrospectionMixin
    - Async processing support
    - Chainable in processing pipelines

    Inheritance Structure:
    - Inherits from TypeIntrospectionMixin for type introspection capabilities
    - Implements Generic[InputT, OutputT] for type safety
    - Abstract base class requiring implementation of process()

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            class SpanToOtelProcessor(Processor[Span, OtelSpan]):
                async def process(self, item: Span) -> OtelSpan:
                    return convert_span_to_otel(item)

    Note:
        Processors are typically added to ProcessingExporter instances to create
        transformation pipelines. The exporter validates type compatibility between
        chained processors.
